New Contributor Tips:

-->Make contributions with respect to any of your learnings, be it by reading related research papers or through your interaction with the community  and submitting a Pull Request (PR) to the repository. You can submit the PR to the README on the main page or the analysis folder README.

-->This is not a one issue per person repo. All the questions are very open ended and different people may find very different and complementary things when looking at a question.

-->Use a reaction emoji to acknowledge a comment rather than writing a comment like "sure" - helps to keep things clean - but the contributor can still let folks know that they saw a comment.

-->When you open an issue and work on a Pull Request relating to the same, add "WIP" in the title of the PR. "WIP" is work in progress. When your PR is ready for review remove the WIP tag. You can also request feedback on specific things while it's still a WIP.

-->Please reference your issues on a PR so that they link and autoclose. Refer to this(https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords).

To check the version of NumPy:
-->  >>import numpy
     >>numpy.version.version
-->  >>import numpy
     >>print(numpy.__version__)
-->  python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.version.version)"
-->  python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
-->  pip freeze | grep 'numpy'  (We can use pip freeze to get any Python package version without opening the Python shell.)
