NumPy's Contributing guidelines
===============================

Welcome to the NumPy community! We're excited to have you here.
Whether you're new to open source or experienced, your contributions
help us grow.

Pull requests (PRs) are always welcome, but making a PR is just the
start. Please respond to comments and requests for changes to help
move the process forward. If you are new to contribution, avoid making questions like - "Can I work on this issue or please assign this to me" instead do your contribution and narrate - "I have done this, review it or Here's my work". It would be easy to help and contribute.
Please follow our
`Code of Conduct <https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/>`__, which applies
to all interactions, including issues and PRs.

Thank you for contributing, and happy coding!
