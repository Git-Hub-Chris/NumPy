  ### Manually-run hooks ###
  # These hooks are disabled by default because NumPy currently has one or more
  # files that are known to fail. You are encouraged to run these hooks if you
  # are changing some files, and aim to have them pass. However, the goal is
  # that somebody doing development is not required to work on anything outside
  # of their own section of interest, so do not worry if other parts of files fail.
  # (though in general, if you would _like_ to fix them, that would be amazing!)
