Compatibility notes
===================

* The changed error message emited by array comparison testing functions
  may affect doctests. See below for detail.

C API changes
=============


New Features
============

divmod operation is now supported for two ``timedelta64`` operands
------------------------------------------------------------------
The divmod operator now handles two ``np.timedelta64`` operands, with
type signature ``mm->qm``.


Improvements
============

Further improvements to ``ctypes`` support in ``np.ctypeslib``
--------------------------------------------------------------
A new ``np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes_type`` function has been added, which can be
used to converts a `dtype` into a best-guess `ctypes` type. Thanks to this
new function, ``np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` now supports a much wider range of
array types, including structures, booleans, and integers of non-native
endianness.

Array comparison assertions include maximum differences
-------------------------------------------------------
Error messages from array comparison tests such as
`np.testing.assert_allclose` now include "max absolute difference" and
"max relative difference," in addition to the previous "mismatch" percentage.
This information makes it easier to update absolute and relative error
tolerances.


Changes
=======

``timedelta64 % 0`` behavior adjusted to return ``NaT``
-------------------------------------------------------
The modulus operation with two ``np.timedelta64`` operands now returns
``NaT`` in the case of division by zero, rather than returning zero
