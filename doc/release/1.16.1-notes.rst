Further improvements to ``ctypes`` support in ``np.ctypeslib``
--------------------------------------------------------------
A new ``np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes_type`` function has been added, which can be
used to converts a `dtype` into a best-guess `ctypes` type. Thanks to this
new function, ``np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` now supports a much wider range of
array types, including structures, booleans, and integers of non-native
endianness.
