Comparison ufuncs will now error rather than return NotImplemented
------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, comparison ufuncs would return `NotImplemented` if their arguments
had structured dtypes, to help the comparison operators deal with those.  This
is no longer needed, as the logic dealing with this case has moved to the
comparison operators proper. Hence, like all other ufuncs, the comparison
ufuncs will now error on structured dtypes.
