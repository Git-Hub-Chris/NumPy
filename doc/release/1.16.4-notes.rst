NumPy 1.16.4 Release Notes
==========================

The NumPy 1.16.4 release fixes bugs reported against the 1.16.3 release, and
also backports several enhancements from master that seem appropriate for a
release series that is the last to support Python 2.7. The wheels on PyPI are
linked with OpenBLAS v0.3.4+,  which should fix the known threading issues
found in previous OpenBLAS versions.

Downstream developers building this release should use Cython >= 0.29.2 and,
if using OpenBLAS, OpenBLAS > v0.3.4.

Potential changes to the random stream
--------------------------------------
Due to bugs in the application of log to random floating point numbers,
the stream may change when sampling from ``np.random.beta``, ``np.random.binomial``,
``np.random.laplace``, ``np.random.logistic``, ``np.random.logseries`` or
``np.random.multinomial`` if a 0 is generated in the underlying MT19937 random stream.
There is a 1 in :math:`10^{53}` chance of this occurring, and so the probability that
the stream changes for any given seed is extremely small. If a 0 is encountered in the
underlying generator, then the incorrect value produced (either ``np.inf``
or ``np.nan``) is now dropped.


C API changes
=============


New Features
============

``.npy`` files support unicode field names
------------------------------------------
A new format version of 3.0 has been introduced, which enables structured types
with non-latin1 field names. This is used automatically when needed.


Improvements
============


Changes
=======

`numpy.lib.recfunctions.structured_to_unstructured` does not squeeze single-field views
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``structured_to_unstructured(arr[['a']])`` would produce a squeezed
result inconsistent with ``structured_to_unstructured(arr[['a', b']])``. This
was accidental. The old behavior can be retained with
``structured_to_unstructured(arr[['a']]).squeeze(axis=-1)`` or far more simply,
``arr['a']``.
