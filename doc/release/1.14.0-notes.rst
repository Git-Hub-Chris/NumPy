Changes
=======

0d arrays now print their elements like numpy scalars
-----------------------------------------------------
0d arrays used to be printed by calling ``style(a.item())`` where
style was either ``str`` or ``repr``. Now they are printed as ``style(a[()])``.

integer scalars are now unaffected by ``np.set_string_function``
----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously the str/repr of integer scalars could be controlled by
``np.set_string_function``, unlike most other numpy scalars. This is no longer
the case.
