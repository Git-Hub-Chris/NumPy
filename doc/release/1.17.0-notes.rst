Array comparison assertions include maximum differneces
-------------------------------------------------------

Error messages from array comparison tests such as
`np.testing.assert_allclose` now include "max absolute difference" and
"max relative difference," in addition to the previous "mismatch" percentage.
This information makes it easier to update absolute and relative error
tolerances.
