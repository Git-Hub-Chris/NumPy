``nickname`` attribute removed from ABCPolyBase
-----------------------------------------------

An abstract property ``nickname`` has been removed from 
`~numpy.polynomial._polybase.ABCPolyBase` as it was no longer used in any of
the derived :doc:`convenience classes <routines.polynomials.classes>`.
This may affect users who have derived classes from ``ABCPolyBase`` and 
overridden the methods for representation and display, e.g. ``__str__``, 
``__repr__``, ``_repr_latex``, etc.
