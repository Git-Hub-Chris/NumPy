``np.unique`` now returns single ``NaN``
----------------------------------------
When ``np.unique`` operated on an array with multiple ``NaN`` entries,
its return included a ``NaN`` for each entry that was ``NaN`` in the original array.
This is now improved such that the returned array contains just one ``NaN`` as the
last element.
