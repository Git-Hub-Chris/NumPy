Matrix transpose support for ndarrays
-------------------------------------
NumPy now offers support for calculating the matrix transpose of an array. The
matrix transpose is equivalent to swapping the last two axes of an array. The
`np.ndarray` and the `np.ma.MaskedArray` now expose a `.mT` attribute.
