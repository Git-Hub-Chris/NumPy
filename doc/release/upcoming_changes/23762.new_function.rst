Matrix transpose support for ndarrays
-------------------------------------
NumPy now offers support for calculating the matrix transpose of an array. The
matrix transpose is equivalent to swapping the last two axes of an array. This
change adds two ways to do this. First `np.ndarray` now exposes a `.mT`
attribute. Second a new function, `np.matrix_transpose`, is added.
