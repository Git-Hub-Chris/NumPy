Changes to the main iterator and potential numerical changes
------------------------------------------------------------
The main iterator used in math functions, for ``np.nditer`` and
on the ``NpyIter`` in the C-API now behaves different for some
buffered iterations.
This means that:

* The actual buffer size used will more often be smaller than
  the maximum buffer sized allowed
* The "growinner" flag is now honored with buffered reqductions
  when no operand requires buffering.

At least for ``np.sum()`` such changes in buffersize can change
the precise numerical results.
Users who use "growinner" for custom reductions could notice
changes in precision (for example, in NumPy we removed it from
``einsum`` to avoid most precision changes and improve precision
for some 64bit floating point inputs).
