New parameter ``equal_nans`` added to `np.unique`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`np.unique` was previously changed to treat NaN values as equal. Now this functionality is decided by setting the ``equal_nans`` parameter to True or False. 

In adding this parameter, the ``equal_nans`` functionality was also fixed to work with the use of the ``axis`` parameter.
