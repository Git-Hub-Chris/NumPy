Add more ufunc loops for ``datetime64``, ``timedelta64``
--------------------------------------------------------
``np.datetime('NaT')`` should behave more like ``float('Nan')``. Add needed
infrastructure so ``np.isinf(a)`` and ``np.isnan(a)`` will run on
``datetime64`` and ``timedelta64`` dtypes. Also added specific loops for
``fmin`` and ``fmax`` that mask ``NaT``. This may require adjustment to user-
facing code. Specifically, code that either disallowed the calls to `isinf`` or
``isnan`` or checked that they raised an exception will require adaptation, and
code that mistakenly called ``fmax`` and ``fmin`` instead of ``maximum`` or
``minimum`` respectively will requre adjustment. This also affects ``nanmax``
and ``nanmin``.
