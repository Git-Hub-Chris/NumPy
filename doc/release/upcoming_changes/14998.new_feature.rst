`numpy.ma.mask_extend_axis` added to generalize `numpy.ma.mask_rowcols`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
`numpy.ma.mask_rowcols` only works on 2d arrays, and takes an ``axis`` argument
with semantics that do not generalize well.

`numpy.ma.mask_extend_axis` generalizes the spirit of this function to N
dimensions, by choosing a simpler definition of ``axis``.

As a result, `numpy.ma.mask_rows` and `np.ma.mask_cols` have been extended
to work on ND arrays, considering rows and columns to be the last two axes.
