Add a numeric ``numpy.version.__version_info__``
------------------------------------------------

This makes it easier and less error prone to write conditional code that
depends on numpy version.

We limit ``__version_info__`` tuple to be numeric only for now with only major/minor/patch.

Dependencies can now check numpy version simply with, for example::

   >>> import numpy
   ... assert numpy.version.__version_info__ > (1, 22)


For most complex comparison, you can make use of ``packaging.version.parse``
which replace distutils's deprecated ``LooseVersion``.
