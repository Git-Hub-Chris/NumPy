Remove handling of extra argument to ``__array__``
Update the documentation for `__array__` interface behaviour 
--------------------------------------------------
Earlier the ``__array__`` documentation said:
If a class (ndarray subclass or not) having the ``__array__`` method is used as the output object of an ufunc, results will be written to the object returned by ``__array__``. However the behaviour of ``__array__``did not support it, the documentation was modified to avoid confusion.
