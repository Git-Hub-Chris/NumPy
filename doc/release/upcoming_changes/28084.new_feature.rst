New function `numpy.random.default_rng().select`
-------------------------------------------------
The new function `numpy.random.default_rng().select` was added, which allows for
vectorized sampling without replacement. It is a step-up from `numpy.random.choice`,
allowing for selecting from an n-dimensional array along axes, with probability
distributions and size constraints. Credit goes to Warren Weckesser for the
initial discovery, prototyping and vision of this new feature.
