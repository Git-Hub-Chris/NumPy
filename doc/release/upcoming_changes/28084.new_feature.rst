New function `numpy.random.Generator.select`
----------------------------------
The new function `numpy.random.Generator.select` was added, which allows for
vectorized sampling without replacement. It is a step-up from `numpy.random.choice`,
allowing for selecting from an n-dimensional array along axes, with probability
distributions and size constraints.
