New comparison and null handling enums for sorting in dtype API
---------------------------------------------------------------

Using the new `NPY_DT_sort_compare` slot, user-defined dtypes can
now specify how to compare elements during sorting operations.
The sort compare function should return a member of the
`NPY_COMPARE_RESULT` enum to indicate the result of the comparison,
including support for unordered comparisons.

The sorting context of type `PyArrayMethod_SortContext` is passed
to the `NPY_DT_get_sort_function` and `NPY_DT_get_argsort_function`
functions and contains a boolean `descending` flag and a
`nan_position` of type `NPY_SORT_NAN_POSITION`, which can be used to
control the behavior of sorting with respect to NaN values.
Currently, sorts are always ascending and nulls are always sorted last,
but this must be checked in the context passed to the sort function
to allow for future features.
