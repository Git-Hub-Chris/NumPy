``count_nonzero`` has been added to ``np.ma``
----------------------------------------------
When ``np.count_nonzero`` is applied to a masked array, it considers masked 
zero value as a non-zero value. Now, ``np.ma.count_nonzero`` has been 
implemented to avoid this issue by separating the array from the mask. The 
function returns the number of non-zero unmasked values in a given array. 
To use it, call ``np.ma.count_nonzero(arr, options)``.
