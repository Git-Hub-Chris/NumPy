``NPY_MAXARGS`` and ``NPY_MAXDIMS`` increased
---------------------------------------------
``NPY_MAXDIMS`` is now 64 and ``NPY_MAXARGS`` is 128, downstream should
not run into issues due to this, as these are typically only used for stack
allocations, such as::

    npy_intp shape[NPY_MAXDIMS];

so that an increase is safe.  It will increase the stack usage a little.

There is however a possible bigger complication if a downstream library uses
one of these in its public headers.
The library user and library might compile against different versions of
NumPy and thus break ABI compatibility.
In this event the downstream library will have to hard-code the old value or
itself force downstream to recompile (if viable).
