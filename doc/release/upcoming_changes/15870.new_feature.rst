``keepdims`` parameter for `numpy.count_nonzero`
------------------------------------------------
The parameter ``keepdims`` was added to `numpy.count_nonzero`. The
parameter has the same meaning as it does in reduction functions such
as `numpy.sum` or `numpy.mean`.  When an ``axis`` argument is given,
the slice along that dimension (or dimensions, if ``axis`` is a tuple
with length greater than one) is reduced to a single number in the
output.  Normally this means the shape of the output array has fewer
dimensions than the input.  When ``keepdims=True`` is used, the output
array has the same number of dimensions as the input, and the lengths
of the reduced dimensions are one.
