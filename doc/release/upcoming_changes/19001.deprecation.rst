Errors will be raised during array-like creation
------------------------------------------------
When an object raised an error during access of the special
attributes ``__array__`` or ``__array_interface__``, this error
was usually ignored.
A warning is now given when the error is anything but AttributeError.
To silence the warning, the type raising a warning has to be adapted
to raise an ``AttributeError``.
