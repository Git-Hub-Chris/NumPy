Metadata and structured dtype information access through functions
------------------------------------------------------------------
The dtype structures fields ``metadata``, ``c_metadata``, ``names``,
``fields``, and ``subarray`` must now be accessed through new
functions following the same names, such as ``PyDataType_METADATA``.
Direct access of the fields is not valid as they do not exist for
all ``PyArray_Descr`` instances.
