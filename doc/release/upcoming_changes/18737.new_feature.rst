generic optimized BLAS and LAPACK via NPY_BLAS_LIBS etal.
---------------------------------------------------------
There is a generic choice for BLAS and LAPACK during build that
is activated by defining NPY_BLAS_LIBS, NPY_CBLAS_LIBS,  and
NPYLAPACK_LIBS in the environment of setup.py to the respective
linker flags. This shortcuts any automatic guessing and allows
simple controlled linkage of BLAS/LAPACK in automated builds,
also possibly to replace the actual implementation at runtime
via stub library links.
