Matrix transpose function support for ndarrays
----------------------------------------------
NumPy now offers support for calculating the matrix transpose of an array. The
matrix transpose is equivalent to swapping the last two axes of an array.
Two new functions ``np.matrix_transpose`` and ``np.ma.matrix_transpose`` are
now available to the user.
