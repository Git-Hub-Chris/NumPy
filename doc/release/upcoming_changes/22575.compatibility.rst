``np.pad`` with ``mode=wrap`` now returns expected results
----------------------------------------------------------

Codes based on earlier version of ``pad`` with ``wrap`` will 
break when padding size is larger than initial array.

``np.pad`` with ``mode=wrap`` now always fills the space with 
strict multiples of original data even if the padding size is larger than the
initial array.
