``np.pad`` with ``mode=wrap`` now returns expected results
----------------------------------------------------------

Codes based on earlier version of ``pad`` with ``wrap`` will 
break when padding size is larger than initial array.

``np.pad`` with ``mode=wrap`` now always fills the space with 
strict loops of original data, as expected.
