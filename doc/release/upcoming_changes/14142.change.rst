Warn when saving a dtype that cannot be loaded
----------------------------------------------
A ``UserWarning`` will be raised when saving an array via `numpy.save` with
``metadata``, since loading such an array will cause a ``ValueError``. This
shorcoming in the NPY format will be addressed in a future release, in the
mean time use pickle instead.
