`numpy.split` and `numpy.array_split` now accept a tuple for ``axis``
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Both `numpy.split` and `numpy.array_split` now accept a tuple for the ``axis`` parameter.
This tuple denotes the axes over which the input array will be split. This means N-dimensional
arrays can now be split over N dimensions in a single call to `numpy.split` or `numpy.array_split`.
When making an N-dimensional split, the output is an N-dimensional object array.
Do note that when ``axis`` is a ``tuple``, it must be specified how the array must be split over each axis.
Therefore, ``indices_or_sections`` must be a list containing as many elements as there are axes in
``axis``. Also note that these elements can also be lists themselves, to allow for splitting on indices
instead of splitting in parts, just like a one-dimensional call to `numpy.split` or `numpy.array_split`.

To use this new functionality, write ``np.split(array, [4, 2], (0, 1))`` or ``np.array_split(array, [4, 2], (0, 1))``
to split ``array`` in ``4`` parts over axis ``0`` and then in ``2`` parts over axis ``1``.
