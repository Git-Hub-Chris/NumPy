Setting the ``strides`` attribute is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------
Setting the strides attribute is now deprecated since mutating
an array is unsafe if an array is shared, especially by multiple
threads.  As an alternative, you can create a new view (no copy) via:
* `np.lib.stride_tricks.strided_window_view` if applicable,
* `np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` for the general case,
* or the `np.ndarray` constructor (``buffer`` is the original array) for a light-weight version.

Manually setting the strides attribute on a NumPy array can be useful, but needs to be done
with care as it can lead to unsafe memory use.
