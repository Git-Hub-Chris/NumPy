NEP 50 promotion state option removed
-------------------------------------
The NEP 50 promotion state settings are now removed. They were always
meant as temporary means for testing.
A warning will be given if the environment variable is set to anything
but ``NPY_PROMOTION_STATE=weak``.
If for some reason your code sets the promotion state to weak with the
semi-private helper, replace it with ``contextlib.nullcontext``.
