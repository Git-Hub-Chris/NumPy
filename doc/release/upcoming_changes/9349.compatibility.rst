``np.vectorize`` follows the descriptor protocol
------------------------------------------------

Before numpy 1.25, a function wrapped in ``np.vectorize`` would *not* follow
the descriptor protocol; in particular, attaching such an object to a class
would implicitly create a static method::

   >>> def func(x):
   ...     return x ** 2
   >>> class C(object):
   ...     static = np.vectorize(func)
   >>> C().static(1)
   1

Since numpy 1.25, the vectorized function now binds ``self`` as the first
argument, and the earlier example will fail.  To recover the earlier behavior,
explicitly wrap ``func`` using ``staticmethod`` before passing it to
``np.vectorize``.
