``keepdims`` optional argument added to `numpy.argmin`, `numpy.argmax`
--------------------------------------------------------------------

``keepdims`` argument has been added to `numpy.argmin`, `numpy.argmax`.
By default, it is `False` and hence no behaviour change should be expected
in existing codes using `numpy.argmin`, `numpy.argmax`. If set to ``True``,
the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one.
In simple words, the resulting array will be having same dimensions
as the input array.
