Improved DLPack protocol detection
----------------------------------
Prior to this release, detecting DLPack protocol support in NumPy was limited
to checking the existence of the `__dlpack__` method on the object's type.
However, this method could be defined on the object itself, leading to
inaccuracies.
With this enhancement, NumPy now checks for the `__dlpack__` method on the
object itself, providing more accurate detection of DLPack protocol support.
