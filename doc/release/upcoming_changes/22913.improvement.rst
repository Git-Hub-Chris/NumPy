MaskedArrays gain a ``__array_function__`` method
-------------------------------------------------

The MaskedArray class now has an implementation of `__array_function__` that
dispatches to a masked version of the function when one is available.
This means that code called with MaskedArray ma as ``np.func(ma)`` will
behave the same as ``np.ma.func(ma)`` when possible.
