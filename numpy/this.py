The Zen of Numpy, by Travis Oliphant  (version 0.1)

Strided is better than scattered.
Contiguous is better than strided.
Descriptive is better than imperative (e.g. data-types).
Array-orientated is better than object-oriented.
Broadcasting is a great idea -- use where possible!
Vectorized is better than an explicit loop.
Unless it's complicated -- then use Cython or numexpr.
Think in higher dimensions.""")
