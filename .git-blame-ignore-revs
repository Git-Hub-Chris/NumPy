# .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# This file contains a list of SHAs that should be ignored by git blame Github
# follows this convention as of approximately 2022-03-24, and Gitlab appears to
# be adding support. The main use case is for large formatting commits as NumPy
# works on acheiving pre-commit compliance. More information at:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files
# /viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view
#
# Ensure commit hashes that appear here exist on main; this will not be the case
# if a pull request with multiple commits squashed before merge (squashing
# performs a rebase that changes commit hashes). In these cases, the commit hash
# will need to be added to this file after the merge.
#
# Note that because of this squashing, it is better to keep large formatting
# pull requests separate from code change pull requests.
